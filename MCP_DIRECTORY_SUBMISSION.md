Key Features:
â€¢ AI-Powered AR Creation - Create complete experiences from natural language descriptions
â€¢ 66+ Specialized Tools - Scene building, animations, physics, asset management, and AR features
â€¢ 6 Experience Templates - Light painting, portals, face filters, image targets, physics playground, model showcase
â€¢ Custom Component Generation - Generate A-Frame components and JavaScript from natural language
â€¢ Asset Discovery - Search and integrate PolyHaven 3D assets
â€¢ Production Ready - 2MB optimized package with all dependencies bundled

Example Commands:
- "Create a light painting AR experience where users can draw with their finger"
- "Add a 3D model of a car with physics and rotation animation"
- "Build a face filter with virtual sunglasses"
- "Create an AR portal to a forest environment"

Perfect for AR developers, designers, educators, and studios who want to prototype faster and explore AR possibilities through conversational AI.

### Additional Notes
```
This is the first AI-powered natural language interface for 8th Wall Desktop AR development. Users can create complete AR experiences through conversation with Claude, without needing to know 8th Wall APIs or A-Frame syntax.

The server includes smart orchestration that automatically identifies AR patterns (face tracking, image targets, world tracking) and chains the appropriate tools. It also features custom A-Frame component generation, JavaScript code generation from natural language, and unified asset discovery.

Unique value: Enables rapid AR prototyping through conversation - what used to take hours of coding can now be done in minutes through natural language.
